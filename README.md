# Asteroids in electron.js

This is my interpretation of asteroids made using vanilla JavaScript, then migrated to an electron.js application.

To install the application:
1. Download the project to your computer.
2. Go to the folder in command prompt etc.
3. Use npm install to install the required packages.

Application runs using the command: `npm start`
Electron can be packaged in to an application using electron-packager, command is: `npm run package-win`
